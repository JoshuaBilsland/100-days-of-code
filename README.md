# 100-days-of-code
## Repo Purpose
This repo will store the code and projects that I have made for each day of the [100 days of code course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). I bought this course in the 2023 Black Friday sales, and I am working through it to learn more advanced programming which will hopefully help my chances of getting a software development apprenticeship. Since I am working full-time, I am not always able to complete a day of the course each day; however, I always try to make some progress each day.
