# TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.
    print(news_json["articles"])

# TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation


    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

# TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

# TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.



#Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
